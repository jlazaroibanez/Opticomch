The following .py archives allow reproducing the simulation results of the 
associated article "Combination of Genome-Scale Models and Bioreactor Dynamics 
to Optimize the Production of Commodity Chemicals".

## Some useful instructions ##

The genome-scale metabolic model used can be downloaded in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1108160000#Files
The fnyzer User Documentation is located in https://fnyzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
It is necessary to install a solver (CPLEX, glpk, Gurobi) in order to compute the numerical values for the 
simulation.
